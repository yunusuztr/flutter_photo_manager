// The title is decorative in an export cache filename: the asset identifier and
// the modification date already identify the asset and its current version, so
// sanitising or shortening the title cannot cause collisions.
//
// It has to be bounded, because it is not under the app's control. Assets
// imported from social apps carry their whole caption as the title, and a name
// component longer than 255 characters makes copying the asset into the cache
// fail with NSFileWriteInvalidFileNameError (514). The file system receives the
// canonically decomposed form of the name, and decomposition turns a UTF-16
// code unit into at most four (UAX #15), so a title of 40 code units takes at
// most 160 characters next to the identifier and timestamp prefix (about 64
// characters) and the extension.
